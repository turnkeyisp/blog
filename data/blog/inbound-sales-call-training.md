# Question

## Inbound sales call from new customer

You get a call from someone who wants to know more about an ISP's services. The caller wants to know if the services are available at their address and what service plans are available. This is for a newly onboarded WISP or telco account. You don't know the answers. What do you do?

# Answers from TurnkeyISP customer service representatives

## 1\. Get caller contact info

"I'll collect as much information as I can, will put the customer on hold for a moment and will look for answers. I will try not to keep the customers on hold too long."

TurnkeyISP customer service representatives are trained to get the full name, email address, phone number, and service address of every caller.

## 2\. Reference the ISP's website

"I would search for the client's main web page and try to figure the information out. If we have a contact from the clients I will ask them and if not getting an answer I will take the customer information, name address and ph# and tell him someone will get back to him."

## 3\. Use the website signup form

"First I gather the customer's information like full name, complete address, email and best contact number. I help the customer sign up through the ISP's website and walk them through how to navigate the website so they can check the service packages and will give a heads up that someone from our sales team will reach out to them."

## 4\. Reference TurnkeyISP's telco client documentation

"In case I was not sure, the first thing I would do is go to the notes on the TurnkeyISP document for that client and also check the documentation. If there is no notes or documentation available, I would get the caller's info and reach out to the client via email, chat or phone to let them know about the call and ask them about the steps I need to follow next."

## 5\. Be confident, keep control of the call

"If I don't know any answers about the services or coverage I would be assertive and confident with the customer "Most definitely, I can assist you with that", to avoid losing control on the call. If I don't have the answer I would simply ask the team while I also try to find that information myself. At that point I would just buy time asking the customer for their information. "Give me a moment while I verify your information on the system" while I wait for an answer and also look around to see if I can find it myself. If I didn't find it or the team didn't reply in a span no less than 10 minutes on a call with the customer I would tell the customer "Hey, I was looking into the system and I need to go over your information to give an accurate reading on your address. Would you mind if I gave you a callback shortly with the results?". It really doesn't hurt to simply ask, I just have to sort how I want the call to go. Also, I think the team won't mind me asking on that matter since we are new to their team and their tools."

## 6\. Schedule a site survey

"If a customer is calling asking for service in his area, depending on the client the call is coming in from I would create an account for cx, gather his or her information, address, phone, full name, email and add it to his account to create him as a lead. I would then escalate to have a sales team reach out. In the case of one client we can schedule a site survey visit to make sure that the service Is available and they will continue from there."

## 7\. Send complete info to the ISP's local team

![complete info](/blog/static/images/complete-info.png)

"Regarding your question about a call from someone who'd want to know more about ISP services - before receiving calls I'd read what the ISP tells on the website in order to be able to tell at least something.Â  But I guess that our main role is to get the customer's address, contact information and send them to the ISP's staff, because availability and exact prices often might be known only after a survey."

## Summary: Team Lead Answer

![call center team lead](/blog/static/images/call-center-team-leads.png)

"Get customer contact info: Full name, physical address, best callback phone number and email address. Check if there is any documentation from the client about handling these types of inquiries. Follow documentation. If not, check the website and see if they have a signup form or a page that shows their plans. You can have the customer look at that page and check if there is a plan to their liking. You can also offer a callback because you will double check some information regarding their inquiry. Reach out to the client on what needs to be done for this call and ask if the plans on the website are still accurate (if there was a page that had up-to-date info) and include the contact details of the customer . Follow whatever instructions the client gives you about the inquiry."
