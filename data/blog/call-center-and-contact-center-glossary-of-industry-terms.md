This guide is intended to help people outside the call center industry familiarize themselves with the common industry terms.

## Abandoned Call

An abandoned call is a call or other type of contact initiated to a call center that is ended before any conversation occurs. When inbound calls are abandoned, it is often because the caller is discouraged by the time on hold or a phone menu that is difficult to navigate.

A call center agent is a person who handles incoming or outgoing customer calls on behalf of an organization. A call center agent might handle account inquiries, customer complaints or support issues.

An agent who manages both incoming and outgoing customer calls is also referred to as a blended agent. Other names for call center agents include customer service representatives (CSRs), contact center agents, technical support representatives (TSRs), associates, operators, account executives or team members.

## Automatic Call Distribution (ACD)

Automatic call distribution systems are phone systems that automatically receive incoming calls and distribute them to the best available agent.

## Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

Automatic speech recognition is technology that provides the ability for a person to interact with a computer application with their voice, thereby eliminating the need to input data using the keypad. For example, automatic speech recognition eliminates the need for callers to “press one” when they contact customer service. It does this by converting a person's words into something a system can use, such as text or a computer command.

In contact centers, Interactive voice response (IVR) systems use automatic speech recognition to enhance the customer experience. When integrated with other applications, ASR technology enables callers to perform self-service tasks, such as checking account balances, as well as authenticating their identity prior to speaking with an agent. Automatic speech recognition can also be useful for identifying why the customer is calling and using this information to route the call to the appropriate agent.
