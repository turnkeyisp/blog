# ISP owner-operators have enough to worry about; hire good people who manage themselves

ISP owner-operators are often times overworked and under resourced. They are typically overloaded with
work. They don't have the extra time or resources to onboard staff who might require extensive training.

# Urgent vs Important

## Subscriber problems are urgent

Subscriber problems are urgent which means they are time-senstive. If you don't address the complaints right away then they
can quickly get worse. The subscribers will cancel their services and bad-mouth your business to their friends and families
and on social media.

## Ugent means time-sensitive, not necessarily important.

Subscriber problems aren't necessarily important. In fact sometimes they are very unimportant. It is hard to imagine how a
Netflix video stream buffering could be considered important. Or how high latency to gaming services would be considered
crtical. While they are urgent, they aren't actually important.

## Growing your business is important, but not necessarily urgent.

TurnkeyISP hires people from all around the world. When we put out a job advertisment we have hundreds of qualified applicants
and we get to select the best applicants. Our team members are the best of the best and they don't need to be micromanaged. In
fact, micromanaging good people is **counter-productive** because good people want to work independently. They can identify
problems on their own and they can creatively find solutionss Especially now that answers to difficult technical problems are
just an internet search away, you don't need to tell good people how to do their jobs. They have the tools and the ability to
figure it out on their own.

# Micromanaging an ISP is a complete waste of everyone's time

# Trust wins, control backfires

When you hire someone with intrinsic motivation then they desire autonomy. When people are trusted to make good decisions about
their work they tend to make good decisions. Theyâ€™ll also come up with more creative solutions than if you had dictated
from on high. Conversely, micromanaging breeds resentment, which degrades the quality of work.

# Hire for the long-term

Typical call centers and staffing services are short-term and high turnover positions. This means that you can't be confident

TurnkeyISP team members are here for the long-term and we work with your business to accomplish your long-term goals. Our team gets
to know your business, your local staff, your network and technologies, and your customers in your commnunity. TurnkeyISP actively
participates in the success of your business. When you are successful then we are successful too!

Typical training styles:

1. Slow, simple, supervised
2. Explicit, lots of repitition, hands-on
3. Mastery learning, hands-on
4. Written materials, plus experience

TurnkeyISP staff training styles:

5. Self-motivated, structured learning
6. Gathers and infers own information

Mastery learning is an instructional strategy and educational philosophy, first formally proposed by Benjamin Bloom in 1968.
Mastery learning maintains that students must achieve a level of mastery (e.g., 90% on a knowledge test) in prerequisite
knowledge before moving forward to learn subsequent information. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning)
