# Urgent vs Important

## Subscriber problems are urgent

Subscriber problems are urgent which means they are time-senstive. If you don't address the complaints right away then they 
can quickly get worse. The subscribers will cancel their services and bad-mouth your business to their friends and families 
and on social media. 

## Ugent means time-sensitive, not necessarily important.

Subscriber problems aren't necessarily important. In fact sometimes they are very unimportant. It is hard to imagine how a 
Netflix video stream buffering could be considered important. Or how high latency to gaming services would be considered 
crtical. While they are urgent, they aren't actually important. 

## Growing your business is important, but not necessarily urgent.
